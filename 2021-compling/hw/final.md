Computational Linguistics, Fall 2020

Haverford College

# Final Project

For your final project, you will undertake a substantial, creative  research project that addresses a question or problem in computational linguistics.  The choice of project is open-ended, and groups are encouraged.  The project will be graded primarily in terms of the rigor of  the experiments, the depth of the analysis, and the quality of the  writing.  Ambitious projects are encouraged. I also **strongly encourage** you to work in groups.  Replicating existing work is a legitimate project.  You may use existing code and frameworks as a starting point for your project, but your project may not consist of merely running someone else's code as is. Non-experimental papers of sufficient depth, such as review papers, are acceptable if you have a clear plan.

## Initial Project Proposal (10 pts)

**Due Nov 6**

Your initial project proposal should clearly define what you intend to study, what your hypothesis is, and cite at least some related work.  It should describe which data you intend to use.  It should be at last one half of a page and contain a timeline for completion, with milestones.  This is to be posted to Piazza and Moodle.

## Revised Project Plan (10 pts)

**Due Nov 13**

I will provide feedback on your initial proposals (10 pts), and, based on this  feedback, you will revise and improve the proposal (10 pts).  This proposal  should clearly cite previous work on the topic and have a revised timeline for any experiments and code landmarks.   Any weaknesses pointed out in my initial review should be addressed. 

Submit: (1) to Moodle with the revised plan and the initial project plan clearly label and (2) to Piazza as a reply to the initial proposal.

## Introduction and Related Work Draft (10 pts)

**Due Nov 20**

To ensure that students have an adequate chance to receive some feedback on their writing, you will submit drafts of the Introduction and Related Work sections to Moodle.  Groups will read each other's drafts and provide feedback in class.

## Final Report (70 pts)

**Due December 15**

This report will be between four and nine pages  Do not insert filler; the grade will  be based on content and not length, but if your report is less than four pages, you likely lack sufficient content.  It should follow essentially the same format as the research papers we read in class.  The report should describe in detail all of your experiments, and you should include links to any code you used.  The code need not be pretty, but it should be understandable.   

**Expectations for Reports**

* Your report must be written in $\LaTeX$, using the ACL template.  Ignore this requirement at your grade's peril.
  You should have, at least, sections that roughly correspond to the following: Introduction, Related Work,  Approach/Model Description,  Results, Analysis, and Conclusion.  Do not use filler to take up space.  This is a waste of everyone's time and bad writing.  I will not  consider space when grading, but content.  Use other scientific papers  as examples.
* See [this](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html), [this](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html), and [this](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/static/style.html) for advice on NLP writing.  
  * With the possible exception of some areas of Related Work and the  Introduction, write nearly everything in the present tense.  It will be  awkward at first, but you'll get used to it.  "We implement as a  baseline a convolutional neural network (CNN) ..." 
    Avoid unnecessary use of modals like "would" and subjective or hyperbolic language like "great" or "incredibly."
  * Use appropriate, grammatical English for a scientific paper. If you know that someone in your group is better at English than everyone else, ensure that this person reads the paper last.
* While I will not usually assist in write code for final projects, I am willing to give  feedback on near-final report drafts if they are sent to me at a  reasonable time (i.e., not immediately before the deadline).  Make good use of Piazza.
* Use BibTeX citations; don't try to write citations manually.  You can often start with the [BibTeX code in Google Scholar](https://libguides.usask.ca/c.php?g=218034&p=1445751). Ditto for referencing figures.  The `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands are very useful.  There's no need to remember the numbers for your tables and figures.
* For research papers, the implementation details aren't generally interesting or important.  You should specify important model/scientific details, such as hyperparameters, learning rates, depth, etc., but likely no one cares that you used Python 3.7 and a hash table.
* See Manning's [course project archive](https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/) for examples of projects. 
* Spell check.  You can do this with `aspell` or `ispell` locally. Overleaf also provides this option.
* Put the names of each group member on the paper.  Include a section at  the end that briefly describes what each member contributed.  If you are concerned about unproductive group members, contact me.

**Grading**

A Range: Exceptionally written paper that does not necessarily  achieve state-of-the-art results, but which provides thorough and logical analysis of results, related work, etc.  Uses graphs, tables, and formulas for clarity.  Contextualizes work in the current literature. Work is replicable from the paper, e.g., all parameters specified, steps enumerated.

B range:  Reasonable paper with some notable grammatical,  organizational, or explicatory problems.  Some methodological problems,  such as single-run experiments or not controlling various factors when  making comparisons.

C range: Paper has major methodological or expository issues, but has some passable experiments that show effort.

D range: Paper is badly written with half-done experiments, but there is some salvageable content.
