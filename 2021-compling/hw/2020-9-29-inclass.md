Today, you will be partitioned into small groups, where you'll address one of the following questions.  You'll submit your summary on Piazza, one for each group.  Be sure to list all of your group members.  You can use any resources (book, online, each other, etc.) to answer the question.  

What aspects of grammar can n-gram language models capture?

* Explain two ways to make logistic regression handle more than two classes.  
* Suppose you have a data in which the examples can belong to more than one class simultaneously.  How might you deal with this?
* Device a scheme to answer multiple choice questions with logistic regression.
* What are Tikhonov regularization, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization and when should one (generally) use one vs. the other.  What is the purpose of lambda (or alpha), and how is it set?
* Devise a way to play the Shannon game with both an n-gram language model and a logistic regression.
* Suppose you use an n-gram language model to generate sentences by selecting the most probable next word.  Will the output be grammatical?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages
