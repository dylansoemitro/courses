# Homework 2: Probability and $n$-grams

This assignment is worth a maximum of 30 points.  You may complete any combination of questions that allows you to reach 30 points.

1. J&M Problem 3.1 (5 pts)

2. J&M Problem 3.2 (5 pts)

3. J&M Problem 3.3 (5 pts)

4. J&M Problem 3.4 (You may either answer this question by hand or write a small Python program to calculate the answer; 5 pts)

5. J&M Problem 3.6 (5 pts)

6. J&M Problem 3.8.  For this problem, you may use any corpus in any human language, perhaps a plain text file from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).  Your pipeline should convert the text to lower case and remove punctuation.    Your program should also tokenize sentences, which you can do with `nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize()`.  For the purposes of this assignment, you needn't worry about accounting for anything else, such as chapter titles.

   

   You can see examples handling text this in [Chapter 1](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html) of the NLTK book.
