Computational Linguistics, Fall 2020

# Lab 3: Simple Text Classification Pipeline

For this lab, you will follow [Chapter 6](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html), Sections 1.1-1.3 of the NLTK book to gain practice working with classifiers.   

In addition to your code (no need to compress it), turn in a *short* report describing the results of the following.

1. Train and test your data on at least two classifiers and report the accuracy -- for example, Naive Bayes and logistic regression/MaxEnt.
2. Try expanding and/or changing the features. How are (1) the accuracy and (2) the most important features affected?  Is it what you expected?
3. Does there appear to be a relationship between training data size and accuracy?


Submit the lab to Moodle, as usual, before the next lab time.
