# Lab 7: WordNet Synsets

For this hour's lab, you will familiarize yourself with WordNet in NLTK.  See [this documentation](https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html) for examples.

Write a simple program using WordNet which, given a sentence, generates two of the following: (1) a paraphrase using synonyms, (2) the opposite of the original meaning (without using explicit negation, such as "not"), or (3) a more general paraphrase.

 Write a short description, including examples, of your approach did this and what did or did not seem to work.
