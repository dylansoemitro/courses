# Pattern Matching

- Pattern matching is a problem as old as computer science
- We've devised a number of mechanisms for pattern matching

---
# Pattern Matching
- Suppoose we have a text document from which we'd like to extract the dates in the following format
```
2020-03-24
1996-04-09
1995-12-03
```
- YYYY-MM-DD

# Regular Expressions
- Regexes provide convenient syntax for describing patterns to match
- A regex describes a **set of strings**
- The regex **recognizes** this set of strings

---
# Regular Expressions
- Set of strings called a **language**
- Set of languages recognizable by regular expressions called **regular languages**
- Describable with only three operations

# Regular Expression Operations
| Operator      | Symbol* | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Concatenation | $\circ$ | $a\circ b$ means b must follow a; often written ab. |
| Union         | $\cup$  | Combine languages $L_1$ and $L_2$                   |
| Star          | *       | A* recognizes A repeated 0 or more times            |
- Concatenation symbol usually omitted.

- Concatenation symbol usually omitted.
- Many more shorthand symbols used
    - `+` for one or more of a symbol
    - superscripts for multiple concatenations, e.g., $a^5=aaaaa$

# Regular Expressions
<!-- footer: Computational Linguistics, Fall 2020\nAlvin Grissom II, Haverford College -->
- Many progamming languages (Java, Python, Perl) have built-in regex support
- Several common Unix tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`) use regexes.
    - Consult documentaiton

---
# Regular Expressions
- In `grep` and many other languages, we use `[0-9]` for number in $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}$, 
- `[A-Za-z]` for alphabetical characters
- Many more

---
# Regular Expressions
- Let's return to date example.
```perl
[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]
```

---
Regular Expressions
- We can use shortcuts.
- Let's return to date example.
```perl
[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]
```

In grep, for example:
```perl
[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}
```
---
# Simple Morphology
- Among other things, morphology is concerned with word inflections

- Consider *compute, computer, computational, computational*

- How might we capture these in a `grep` regex?

---
# Simple Morphology 

```
 grep "comput\(e|er\|ation\|ational\)"
```
- All finite languages are regular

- Regexes are powerful but have limitations

- Infinitely many non-regular languages
    - $L=a^ib^i$

---
# Finite State Automata
- A finite state automaton (FSA) is an abstract computational model
    - Studied in depth in Theory of Computation

- Graphically, consists of **states** (squares or rectangles) and **transitions** (arrows).

- Deterministic and non-deterministic automata
    - Deterministic FSA called **DFA**  
    - Nondeterministic FSA called **NFA**

---

# Finite State Automata
- In a deterministic finite state automaton, the machine can be in exactly one state (circle or square) at a given time.
- From the state, it can follow a **transition** (arrow) to another state.

# Finite State Automata

- NFAs introduce $\epsilon$-transitions, which consume empty string $\epsilon$.

- In an NFA, we only need one valid path to an acceptance state for an input string.

- NFAs and DFAs recognize the same languages, so we'll use NFAs

	2 --> [*] : 系
</div>
<center>

---
# Finite State Automata

- If we cannot reach an accepting state, the input string is rejected
    - String is outside of the language

---
# Finite State Automata
- Bottom line:
    - The set of languages recognized by NFAs is the same as the set of languages recognized by DFAs.
    - The set of languages recognized by DFAs is the same as the set of languages recognized by regexes.
    - If there exists a regex for a set of strings, there exists an NFA and a DFA for it, as well.
    - There are many languages unrecogniziable by regexes, e.g., $a^ib^i$.
