# Computational Linguistics
## Day 1: Introduction
---
# Course Description
- Standard introduction to computational linguistics and natural language processing
- Project/experiment-focused
- Remote
---
# Course Description
- By nature interdisciplinary.
- Mathematics
    - Probability/Statistics, Linear Algebra, Information Theory
    - We'll introduce this gradually

---
# Topics
 -Mathematical fundamentals, regular expressions, neural networks, latent variable and graphical models, topic models, parsing and tagging, machine translation, information retrieval, word embedings, semantics fundamental, ethics, fairness, and more

 ---
 #  Texts
 - [Speech and Language Processing, by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
 - Race Aftere Technology, by Ruha Benjamin
 
 ---

# Course Structure
- Largely, but not entirely, flipped.
- Check schedule for required reading/watching for next class.
- Heavily project-focused
- Discussion
- Labs

---
# Assignment Submission
- Read each assignment for details.
- Will generally be via Moodle.
- Create a GitHub Student account right now.
    - If you prefer not to, let me know.
- Assignments due on specified day
    - Assignments not conforming to guidelines will be returned ungraded

---
# Discussion Boards
 - In general, at least one comment per assignment.
 - You are **strongly encouraged** to ask and answer questions on discussion board.
 - Do not post code.
 - Ses syllabus for Honor Code details
 - I'll occasionally post CL news articles
     - Optional unless otherwise specified.

---
# Communication
 - I will generally check Piazza at ~4:30 every non-holiday weekday for questions.
 - You may email me, but you will be competing with hundreds of other emails.  Piazza will likely be faster.
 - Post general questions to the discussion board instead of e-mailing me directly.
 - You may make a one-on-one appointment.

---
 # Assignments
 - Several assignments will require reports.
 - These must be written in Markdown or $\LaTeX$.
 - Markdown is easier to use than pure LaTeX for many things.
   - Recommended: Download Typora and read its [Markdown reference](https://support.typora.io/Markdown-Reference/).
- These slides were rendered in a Markdown tool called Marp.
- Final project will be in pure $\LaTeX$

# Working Remotely
- I'll assume you're working remotely and using a lab machine remotely.
- This makes troubleshooting easier, since I won't usually have to figure out what's wrong with your computer.
- You will need to use the command line.
- You should learn the basics of a terminal mode text editor, which will allow you to program on a remote machine.  
    - I use `emacs`. Feel free to use `vi` or `pico`, but I can't help you with that.
    - I'll walk you through this.
