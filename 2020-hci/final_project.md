# Semester Project

Note: Due to this course unexpectedly being moved online, one of the planned planned homework assignments has been combined with the final project. 



For your final/semester project, you may do one of the following, either as a group (preferred) or individually:

* Write a survey research paper (4-6 pages) on an HCI concept or technology.  A survey paper, as the name suggests, surveys the work on a particular topic, synthesizing the information and providing context. Such a paper should provide context for the topic being discussed and cite relevant research papers in an appropriate citation format.  Also see the textbook for guidelines for writing a scientific paper.  I am happy to review drafts. We will review the planned survey paper as a class.

* Implement an HCI concept or technology -- either one that you create yourself or one that already exists -- and evaluate its effectiveness. If you choose to go this route, you will need to (1) create a design document that describes what you intend to do, what you intend to achieve, and how you will evaluate its effectiveness. We will review such documents as a class and make suggestions. For the purposes of this project, this should be no more than two pages and may include graphics.  You must also (2) implement the project and write a report (2-4) pages with sections for (at least) Introduction, Related Work, Results, and Analysis.

* A significant portion of this course consists of reading and discussing challenging material on ethics, design, and surveillance in the context of HCI.  Write a research paper or essay (6-10 pages) that tackles any of topics we have discussed in this course.  Papers will be graded based on clarity, grammar, and content.  Papers should appropriately cite previous work and have a clear thesis.  I am happy to review drafts.

* Create a mobile app that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Android Development Kit.* Your app may use a tablet, smartwatch, or phone.  *Note that while Android is preferred, you may use another toolkit if you prefer, as long as it is approved beforehand.

  Some suggested projects are the following: apps to remind a user to do something at intervals (e.g., take breaks from typing, walk, review flashcards), physical activity measurer, a simple game, a creative clock, reference materials (e.g., dictionary, code/Linux commands), a language translator, and so on. Projects need not be complex, as this is an introduction.  Since the remainder of the course is online, we cannot provide you with Android tablets and smartwatches, but you may use either the emulator or your own devices.  If you work with others, use GitHub or a similar service to collaborate. 
  Consider the following when designing your program.  We will review the planned project as a class and have weekly updates on progress.

  - Programs runs correctly without crashing. 

  - Affordances conveyed. 

  - Program provides feedback. 

  - Program is enjoyable to use (doesnâ€™t become unusable if something goes wrong, provides appropriate timing). 

  - Provides personalization and security (e.g., remembers preferred name, login password) (10pts)

  - Accessible to people with disabilities. 

  - Voice input. 

  - TTS interface 

  - Interacts with other devices directly 

  - Use extra features of device (i.e., gyroscope, cameras). 

  - Run on an actual Android device 
  - Accessibility
  - Ethics

* If you would like to attempt a project not listed here, discuss it with the professor.
