# Lab 3: Regularization

For this lab, you'll revisit the MNIST dataset from the previous lab.  I recommend using the previous lab's code as a starting point.  Instead of varying the training data, you'll focus on the regularization parameters.  Create plots of the accuracy as the regularization parameter $\lambda$ increases and analyze the results. Do this for L1 and L2 regularization with logistic regression.

- I recommend starting with 0, moving to .0001 and increasing at a regular rate.
- What is the best regularization parameter you found?  
- Is there a training data size effect?
- What explains the patterns you found?
  - Does a higher regularization parameter always improve accuracy?
