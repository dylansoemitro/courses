# Homework 1 (50 points)

This assignment is to be done in LaTeX.  You may use Markdown + LaTeX, but you should turn in a PDF.  If you use pure LaTeX, use an [assignment template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/elec-340-assignment-3/rtdvnfppgfft), not an article template.  Please ensure that your submissions are readable.  If you do not know how to accomplish something in LaTeX, ask on Piazza.   Numbered exercises are from [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage) by David Barber.

- **Problem 1 (10 pts):** Exercise 10.1 (Hint: See Example 10.2)
- **Problem 2 (10 pts):** 
  **(a)** Building off of the previous problem, suppose that instead of binary classes (> 60 or < 60), your data consists of a discrete set of ages, *A*, in [0,100] and probabilities *p* ∈ [0,1] for each age, respectively. Write an compact equation for the probability of people over age 60.
  - **Problem 2 (b)** Do the same for the continuous case.
- **Problem 3: (20 points)** Exercise 10.5 (all parts)
- **Problem 4:** The Dirichlet distribution (Chapter 8) is a distribution over multinomial distributions.  In a typical probability distribution, you  are sampling some value.  In a Dirichlet distribution, you are sampling a distribution, Q ~ Dir(**α**).  Here, **α** is a vector of parameters that determines how likely the distributions are to be sampled, akin to skewness in the two-dimensional case.  An **α** of <1,1,1> in the $\mathbb{R}^3$ case is uniform: all distributions are equally likely.   The Dirichlet  distribution models the randomness within a set of distributions, which  can be visualized as a simplex. (A simplex is an *n-1*-dimensional shape in $\mathbb{R}^n$).  That is, the Dirichlet is a distribution over a *family* of distributions with some random perturbation, parameterized by **α** to enforce either sparsity or density of the probability mass across  the simplex.  When enforcing sparsity, samples are more spread out in  the simplex; when enforcing density, they tend to be sampled from the  same area. A symmetric Dirichlet is a Dirichlet where all values of **α** are the same.

**(4a, 5 points)** Why might we want to sample a distribution itself?   Briefly explain your intuition.  If helpful for your explanation, use an example. 

**(4b, 5 points)** Consider the symmetric Dirichlet distributions Dir(<1,1,1>),   Dir(<2,2,2>), and Dir(<0.1,0.1,0.1>). Rank them by entropy.  Explain.
